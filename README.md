This is an Assignment at Cairo University through Operating System 2 course at Faculty of computers and information to simulate Desk scheduling techniques algorithms FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, C-SCAN, and C-Look by implementing their algorithms and applying it on a disk queue with requests for I/O blocks on cylinders
Cairo University
Faculty of Computers & Information
Advanced Operating System (2014-2015)
Assignment 3
Disk Scheduling
for algorithms FCFS, SSTF,SCAN, C-SCAN, and C-Look by implementing their algorithms and applying it on a disk queue with
requests for I/O blocks on cylinders.
Example of cylinders I/O requests:
98, 183, 37, 122, 14, 124, 65, 67
Initial head start cylinder: 53

Note:
FCFS will not change the sequence for serving the queue but may give us a different total head
movement based on the initial head start cylinder.
It Designs and Implements a graphical user interface for simulating the head movements,  GUI 
simulate the head moves dynamically as the below image.
